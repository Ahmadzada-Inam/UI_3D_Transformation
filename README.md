# UI_3D_Transformation

UI_3D_Transformation demonstrates applying 3D effects to an arbitrary UIView

A few different views are chosen randomly to facilitate this example: images,
a map view, and a web view. A view hierarchy is shown that is akin to the tab
switching user experience in Safari on iOS and the 3D nature of this effect is
implemented using CALayer's CATransform3D.
